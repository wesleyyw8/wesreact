Some thoughts about this project. <br />
1 - I decided to do it using reactJS/redux because it is the technologies that you guys use. <br />
2 - "Set Availability to '0 seats left' for all tours in the current group. Update the background color for the title of the current group (red)." - I think you wanted to say the current tour to red. It wouldnt make any sense to change the background of the whole group if just one of the tours is unavailable. <br />

npm run testCoverage to test the files that I specified on the jest.config
